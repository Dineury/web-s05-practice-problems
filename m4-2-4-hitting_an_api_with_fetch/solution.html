    DIRECTIONS: Below are solutions to all the practice problems for this learning objective. You can try each solution by copying it into your "index.html" file and clicking "Run".

    /*
    PROBLEM 1:
    Below, we are fetching Earth data from `planetURL`. You can see the data printing in the console.
    Edit the success handler and add a new console log that prints:
      "Earth is a planet 12756 Km in diameter, with a rotation period of 24 hours, which takes 365 days to go around the Sun".
    But the string must be built using the data from the API, as opposed to simply copying and pasting the text above.
    You can then try fetching different planets by editing the planet id at the end of the `planetURL`.
    */
    const planetURL = 'https://webapis.bloomtechdev.com/planets/3'
    fetch(planetURL)
      .then(res => {
        return res.json()
      })
      .then(planet => {
        console.log(planet)
        // ENTER YOUR CODE HERE
        const { name, diameter, rotation_period, rotation_around_sun } = planet
        console.log(`${name} is a planet ${diameter} Km in diameter, with a rotation period of \
${rotation_period} hours, which takes ${rotation_around_sun} days to go around the Sun`)
      })

    /*
    PROBLEM 2:
    Use fetch to obtain the data from Mars from the `marsURL`.
    On success, print to the console a message of your liking using the data from the API.
    */
    const marsURL = 'https://webapis.bloomtechdev.com/planets/4'
    // ENTER YOUR CODE HERE
    fetch(marsURL)
      .then(res => { return res.json() })
      .then(mars => {
        console.log(`${mars.name} is my favorite planet!`)
      })

    /*
    PROBLEM 3:
    Use fetch to obtain the data of all the planets using the `solarSystemURL`.
    On success loop over the planets, at each planet printing "<name> is number <id>" using the data from the API.
    */
    const solarSystemURL = 'https://webapis.bloomtechdev.com/planets'
    // ENTER YOUR CODE HERE
    fetch(solarSystemURL)
      .then(res => { return res.json() })
      .then(planets => {
        planets.forEach(pl => console.log(`${pl.name} is number ${pl.id}`))
      })
