    PROBLEM 1:
    We are using Axios to request all planets in the Solar System, including Pluto of course. On success, loop over the planet objects, and for each planet, append to div#planets the markup shown below (Mercury used as an example):

    <div>
      <h3>Mercury</h3>
      <p>Diameter: 4879 Km</p>
      <p>Rotation: 58.6 hours</p>
      <p>Orbital Period: 88 days</p>
    </div>

    When the problem is solved correctly, the page should look like the `design.png` file found inside this project.

    const planets = 'https://webapis.bloomtechdev.com/planets'
    axios.get(planets) // ADD YOUR CODE HERE

    /*
    PROBLEM 2:
    Although this is misguided, find a way to prevent _planet_ Pluto from rendering to the DOM.
