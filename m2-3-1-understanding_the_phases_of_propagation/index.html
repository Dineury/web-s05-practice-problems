      Add a listener for event of type "click" to the elements right above. The first two are done for you.
      Also add a click event listener to the `document` object.
      Open the Console and click on the button. Do you see the click event bubbling up the DOM?

      PROBLEM 2:
      Add a click event listener to the global `window` object, but set it to fire on capture, instead of on bubbling.
      Open the Console and click on the button. Do you see the captured click event on the `window` object, firing first?
